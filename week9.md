# Week 09: CSS Part One: Color, Type and Boxes

We will be meeting in our [Private Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/qc-design/shared_invite/zt-2pp65669v-dFXbGUpIfD_jHjGZEX~S0A).

### Lecture

During this class, we will begin styling our websites using Cascading StyleSheets (CSS). We will go over the basics of CSS by focusing on:

- color
- typography
- boxes.

The readings will really help with the second part of the semester - make sure you have caught up! We should be up to Chapter 13 in the textbook by now, and up to chapter 17 by next week!

### In-Class Assignment

Update the Glitch project you made for class two weeks ago and link an external CSS to it.
Apply what we learned today by updating:

- Type
- Boxes

### Homework

Try to recreate the CSS you created during class, except using only text prompts to chatGPT - without editing the CSS.
Post the link to your glitch project with the external CSS file, a copy of your chat GPT transcript to your blog post.
In 2-3 paragraphs, describe your experience writing CSS on your own compared to asking an AI for help on your blog post.
Read the following chapters:

- Chapter 14: Lists, Tables & Forms
