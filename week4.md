We will be meeting in our [Private Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/qc-design/shared_invite/zt-2pp65669v-dFXbGUpIfD_jHjGZEX~S0A).

### Lecture

In this class, we'll have an overview lecture on graphic design, covering topics such as form, color theory, typography, grid structures, and logos. Additionally, we'll conduct a Photoshop workshop to explore its optimal use in website design. You should by the end of this lecture have enough to get started on designing a logo and a homepage to get you started on your website!

There is an in-class as well as a homework assignment, which you can find below.

### In-Class Assignment
Let's get started on the website you are going to build for the semester! First, during class, create a logo or logotype for your website using Adobe Illustrator. Begin by exploring your name or companyâ€™s name in at least five different typefaces. Experiment with various forms and shapes to see how they interact with the typography.

Check out these sites for inspiration for your logos:
- [BrandNew](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew)
- [The Design Blog](http://thedsgnblog.com/)
- [Logo Design Love](http://www.logodesignlove.com/)

Once you have a logo or logotype for your website, share with the Slack channel and then start working on your homework for the week.

### Homework
1. Design three distinct versions of your website's homepage using the 960 grid system. Explore different color schemes, typefaces, hierarchy, grids, images, icons, and other elements. You may use the photoshop example above or the placeit website to get started.
2. Once you've completed all three designs, upload JPEG images of them to your blog, along with a brief explanation of the concept and inspiration behind each design.
3. Prepare a presentation of your three websites using [Loom](loom.com/), [Synthesia](https://www.synthesia.io/), or by recording a video.
4. Read Chapter 1 (Structure) of the HTML & CSS book.
