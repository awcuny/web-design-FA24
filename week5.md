# Week 05: Secondary Page Design

We will be meeting in our [Private Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/qc-design/shared_invite/zt-2pp65669v-dFXbGUpIfD_jHjGZEX~S0A).

### Lecture

There is no lecture during this class - we will instead go through your three homepage designs you did for your homework. You will also share your presentation videos, made with Loom, Synthesia or by recording yourself in front of your website. Any student that has not finished recording their video, you'll have to do it during this class.

There is an in-class as well as a homework assignment, which you can find below.

### In-Class Assignment
1. Working on your own, write down all your dimensions and measurements for your website
2. Make a list of all your typefaces, type sizes, type colors, background colors, etc.
3. Start creating your folders to organize your materials.
4. Start creating all your images and put them into your images folder.

### Homework
1. Select one of your homepage designs as your final design. Make any necessary refinements to it based on the feedback you received in class today. Complete the secondary page designs based on the selected homepage design. Do a design for each unique secondary or tertiary pages (i.e. About, Portfolio, Contact, an individual project detail page, etc.). Post your final designs to your blog.
2. Start preparing your midterm presentations and post your progress on the blog.
3. Read Chapter 1 (Structure) of the HTML & CSS book.
