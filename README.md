### Course Description
When designing in general, and especially when it comes to web or interaction design, these four steps are key when it comes to developing a website from start to finish: Discover, Define, Design and Develop. Over the next few months in this class we will go over the four D’s in detail. ”Discover” really focuses on the research that must not be overlooked when starting to design for a website, whether it is competitive audits, current client brand understanding or market research. You must “define” the user experience and figure out the structure of the website by creating sitemaps and wireframes. Then comes the “design” process, which includes static designs based on the wireframes that have already been created. These designs are normally created in Photoshop. Finally comes website “development” which is usually created using front-end programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Occasionally designers will also program templates for a content management system (CMS) like Drupal, WordPress or any other common CMS platforms but this requires more advanced programming skills like PHP, Python and Ruby. (We will not have time to cover these languages in this class.)

### Course Objectives
The first half of the semester will be entirely focused on the discover, define and design stages. Discovery will consist of the research need to determine who we are designing the website for, what are our competitors already in the space, how can we differentiate from those competitors. Define will take the research to help design our sitemaps and wireframes which are the underlying architecture for the website. To build these sitemaps and wireframes we will be using Adobe Illustrator. Design is focusing on the look and feel of the website looking at color, typography, layout, etc. We will be using tools like Adobe Photoshop and Sketch App to create our designs.

The second half of the semester will be focusing entirely on develop. We will take our static designs and build them out using HTML and CSS. Each week will be focusing on a different aspect of HTML and CSS like layout, typography, color, etc. and applying what we learn to our website builds. We will be using Glitch.com as a programming environment and hosting provider.

At the end of the semester each student will have a complete website built using HTML, CSS and maybe some JavaScript which will be hosted online at Glitch.com.

### Learning Outcomes
Students will learn the basics of user experience design and user interface design when it comes to designing a website. They will become comfortable using such platforms like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and potentially Sketch App and Figma. They will also have a solid understanding on how to program a website using HTML and CSS as well as some JavaScript.

### Course Requirements
Class participation is mandatory. You are expected to be present, to participate in a positive, constructive manner, and to produce work that is full of energy, completed and presented to the best of your ability. **We will be meeting live via zoom during the first class, midterm presentations, and final presentations. Students are expected to be active on the Slack channel during other classtimes.**

It is your responsibility to turn in work on time, to make up any missed assignments, and to catch up with the class in the event of an absence. Late work is unacceptable; however, this work can be turned in for partial credit. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance. For the most up-to-date information (including what is due next class) visit [the class website](https://awcuny.github.io/web-design-FA24/). 

This is a hands-on course and regular attendance is necessary for participation. You will be graded on in-class participation. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance. Students who miss numerous classes will find it difficult to pass the course. Visual assignments and projects will be graded based on: one for technical merit, concept and your demonstrated ability to understand the code. Your final grades will be calculated by the following: 80% project, 20% participation. You are expected to spend as much time working outside the classroom as you work inside the classroom. Schedule your time accordingly.

### AI Policy
Understanding how and when to use generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude) is quickly emerging as an important skill for future professions. In fact, it's even built-in to some search engines and even web browsers! To that end, you are welcome to use generative AI tools in this class as long as it aligns with the learning outcomes or goals associated with assignments. You are fully responsible for the information you submit based on a generative AI query (such that it does not violate academic honesty standards, intellectual property laws, or standards of non-public research you are conducting through coursework). Your use of generative AI tools must be properly documented and cited for any work submitted in this course.

In this course, students shall give credit to AI tools whenever used, even if only to generate ideas rather than usable text or illustrations. When using AI tools on assignments, add an appendix showing (a) the entire exchange, highlighting the most relevant sections; (b) a description of precisely which AI tools were used (e.g. ChatGPT private subscription version or DALL-E free version), (c) an explanation of how the AI tools were used (e.g. to generate ideas, turns of phrase, elements of text, long stretches of text, help troubleshoot code, etc.); (d) an account of why AI tools were used (e.g. to save time, to surmount writer’s block, to make non-copyrighted imagery, to translate text, to experiment for fun, etc.). Students shall not use AI tools during in-class examinations, or assignments unless explicitly permitted and instructed. Overall, AI tools should be used wisely and reflectively with an aim to deepen understanding of subject matter.

It is a violation of university policy to misrepresent work that you submit or exchange with your instructor by characterizing it as your own, such as submitting responses to assignments that do not acknowledge the use of generative AI tools. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions you may have about the use of generative AI tools before submitting any content that has been substantially informed by these tools.

And also - don't forget, you are here to learn. If you rely heavily or completely on these AI tools to do your work for you, please ask yourself why you are enrolled in this course. And be aware that AI is an emerging technology. AI systems can provide helpful information or suggestions, but they are not always reliable or accurate. Students should critically evaluate the sources, methods, and outputs of AI systems. If you have any questions about this policy or if you are unsure whether a particular use of AI is acceptable, please do not hesitate to ask for clarification

### The criteria for grading is as follows:

### Attendance:
Two (unexcused) absences result in grade drop and four absences result in a failing grade. Late
or early departure from class (15 minutes) is the equivalent of ½ absence.

### Grading
- To earn an A
 - All class work and homework is excellent. Projects have been completed when assigned. The work shows a development and understanding of the principles discussed in class. It is presented immaculately. There is regular and prompt attendance and participation during critiques and an enthusiasm toward the material being presented throughout the semester. This is exceptional work.
- To earn a B
 - All assigned work completed in a thorough manner. An understanding of the principles and
lessons covered in class is evident. The student comes to class regularly and on time and
participates in critiques and discussions. This is better than average work.
- To earn a C
 - Most class assignments and homework have been completed. Regular attendance but minimal
or negative class participation. There is understanding of most of what’s being presented in
class. This student shows some interest in the course content. This is average work.
- To earn a D
 - Most class assignments and homework have not been completed. Marginal effort made to
understand the course objectives and very little or negative participation on behalf of the
student. Spotty attendance. This means below average work.
- To earn an F
 - Student has not completed 1⁄3 of the course work and has missed too many classes. This
student doesn’t participate or has a bad attitude and shows no interest. It means not enough
work, attendance, and/or effort to pass the class.
- W Withdrawal.
 - If a student officially withdraws from a class during the add/drop period it will be deleted from his/her permanent record.
