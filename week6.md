We will be meeting in our [Private Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/qc-design/shared_invite/zt-2pp65669v-dFXbGUpIfD_jHjGZEX~S0A).

### Lecture

In this class, we finally move from Discovery, Define and Design to Development! The lecture video covers how to properly create Photoshop templates for images, list proportions and dimensions, and organize file structures. We will also start to talk about HTML.
