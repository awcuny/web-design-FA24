# Week 02: Competitive Audits and Analysis

We will be meeting in our [Slack channel](https://qc-design.slack.com/archives/C07H6BMBFAQ).

### Lecture

Let's go over how the internet works. We will review Prof Danne Woo's video lecture on browsers, servers and how they communicate to create visual websites.

This week, we will continue to review the basics of how the internet and the world wide web works. Then, the lecture will get a little bit technical to cover the very basics of HTML and CSS, and how to read the source of every website using developer tools.

Then, we will cover what market analysis and competitive visual audits are. The first step when creating a website is really understanding the users that will be viewing the site, researching any potential competitors and really understand the market you will be entering. This process historically has been a two person job,** a designer and a strategist**. The strategist helps define who the end user will be and how the website will stand out in the existing market. The designer takes the strategist findings to help them create a structure, visual language and brand for the website. During this class we will review some case studies, go over the strategists role in detail as well as dissect and analyze an existing website.
