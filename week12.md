# Week 12: Basics of JavaScript
We will be meeting in our [Private Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/qc-design/shared_invite/zt-2pp65669v-dFXbGUpIfD_jHjGZEX~S0A).

### Lecture

No video today! This lecture is an overall review of the basics of JavaScript and jQuery, a framework for JavaScript.

JavaScript helps make your static HTML and CSS websites interactive and dynamic. It's included in most modern browsers and all modern devices. There are many other frameworks other than jQuery, including D3js, ThreeJS and DojoJS.
