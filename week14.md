# Week 14: Final Presentations

We will be meeting [over zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88550250169?pwd=aarkIEWL6fSN06XbLaBQyGsiloIFtB.1).

### Final Class
During this class, you will be presenting your finals. We will spend the first fifteen minutes introducing our guests and then we will begin your presentations over zoom. Make sure to **sign up for when you'll present your finals on this [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZciMD_OrbMrUEE326ICEsEX7zjKnFumHoQLWXQGchU/edit?usp=sharing).**

You do not need to create slides for your final presentation. You just need to help us navigate through your site and let us see your code. Your websites must include:

- A working homepage
- A minimum of two secondary pages
- Working links that can navigate between all three sites
- Access to the code so we can read it

Post the URL of your website in your blog. The deadline to submit your final website is December 14, 2024 at 10 am EST.
